With Due respect I would like to ask that why my score has been reduced in the dashboard while the mail which I received has more marks. Further more I would like to ask that there is no grace marks to pass the score while other subjects have some policy. Due to some issues I couldn’t study well and I didn’t pass the course with only 1.5 marks. Due to high fees and I do not fall under any Fees relaxation policy. So please sir I would like to request for a better decision. So that I would end up my Diploma by next term. It’s a kind request sir to look into it and please help me out. If I pass this course I would end my diploma by next term.


I cannot add two image files

The scores in the email are correct. The scores on the dashboard are correct. But the total is wrong in the dashboard. It looks like an website/operations issue. Have you checked the dashboard again? There was a problem earlier, and i was told it was corrected.


If it has been corrected then let us know. If not I will refer it to operations. On our end everything is correct. Its a portal problem.


Kind regards

Hi Utkarsh,


Even if the marks change to your actual marks, operations will not give the 1.5 marks for passing, but I am more concerned about the difference in the dashboard, because it might affect some others as well. So thanks for letting us know.

Hi Utkarsh,


Once again I want to thank you for raising the issue. There was an operational error and it is being dealt with. You might see a grade change along with several students.

Greetings sir , [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil)


I am a diploma student currently in the last term of this level but due to Grade U, I wouldn’t be able to complete this level by next term. I only 1.5 grace marks to pass this course. I didn’t knew the difficulty of this course because the rating of this course on discourse is wrong. So I took this subject but wasn’t able to give proper time to it. Somehow I managed to do the course but due to only 1.5 marks, I am not able to pass the course. I have only 4 course left, So if I pass this course I’ll be able to complete diploma by next term. Further sir, I do not fall under any fees relaxation policy, So sir I have to pay the same fees again for the same course.  So it’s a huge request sir to grant me some grace marks to pass the course. If the difference was more I wouldn’t request at all. Even sir in the last term I repeated MLT because the difference was high and I couldn’t make it but I managed to pass it in this term. Sir I request you grant me some grace marks. My score is 38.6 so If you grant me 1 marks and round it off. then sir I’ll be able to pass it and will finish diploma by next term. Sir it is huge request sir. Please consider it as exception and sir this will be my last request because I respect your decision and will not make any further request.


Thank you sir


sincere regards
