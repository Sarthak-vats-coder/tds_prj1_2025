Hi Sir,


[![The image shows a screenshot of a browser window displaying an online exam or quiz.  The current question involves moving and renaming files using a Linux command line and calculating the SHA256 checksum of the resulting folder. A subsequent question deals with SQL and the SQLite database.  The exam timer shows the test ended at 11:59 pm on May 18th, 2025. The student's score is 5.25 out of 10.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/4/14a2c40fe5cb7b94b8b4aeccb4b47b997ca77bae_2_690x388.png)image1920×1080 248 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/4/14a2c40fe5cb7b94b8b4aeccb4b47b997ca77bae.png)


I kept on saving while solving each question in GA-1, My final score was 5.25 which we can find in the above screenshot.


But now, when I go to GA-1 and open the site, it is showing my answers but total score at the top is showing “ZERO”. See below.

The assignment involves writing an SQL query to calculate the average order value for "shipped" orders (case-insensitive).  A partially completed SQL query is visible, along with a score of 0. A WhatsApp chat window is also visible, showing a message about the assignment's final score.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/2/924bb33d72453fccb7ea190be989019a9e3647f0_2_690x388.png)image1920×1080 142 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/2/924bb33d72453fccb7ea190be989019a9e3647f0.png)


Something strange. Anyone having this issue?

Check the “Recent saves (most recent is your official score)” section. That should tell you your last saved score.

[![A pale green box displays three recent game saves with timestamps and scores.  The most recent save (May 12th, 2025, 9:14:29 PM) shows a score of 10 and is designated as the official score.  Each save has a "Reload" button.

I think our last saved score are stored in the backend.And after deadline last saved score posted to course database automatically.


Same thing happened for me also.
