Hello Sir,


I just received a mail stating that there will be a class on 15th May covering Linux and Bash-related concepts from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM.


However, there’s already an MLF live session scheduled at the same time on 15th May.

Unfortunately there are no open evening slots during the work week. Many people either have work or offline college or household responsibilities during the day. So evenings are the best for schedule. We have tried daytime sessions before, but they were poorly attended.


This is currently the scheduling timetable for this term.

No worries, Sir. I understand that it’s difficult for you as well to take extra sessions because there are already multiple classes scheduled every day.


Just one request—if possible, it would be great if you could live stream the session on 15th May, so I can watch it after attending the MLF session.


Otherwise, the recorded session usually takes some time to be uploaded.


If it’s not possible, no problem at all, Sir—I’ll manage.

We cant live stream, because we have an AI processing pipeline that we need to use before upload.


But we are trying to get the workflow to the point where it is available within 6 to 12 hours of the session being held. (We are still doing some fine tuning and working out some bugs on the automation tool - currently its a semi - manual automated process).
