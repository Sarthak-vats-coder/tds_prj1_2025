I have created a sample tabel in my local system and done the given sql opeations on it and it is working fine on it. So how can I raise the complaint aginst it so that I can paste the excat query for the verification.


And also there is another question with assignment portal all the changes are been saved but on the course dashboard it still showing assignment not completed like this

Hi [@23ds2000044](/u/23ds2000044) : Regarding assignment status in the portal. The assignment status can only be seen in the tds site and it is not linked to the main course portal. So the submission status will not be seen there.
