Your answer is absolutely correct [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573)


But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

Hello Sir"s, [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)


I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.


My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.


I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode

This carries a lot of weight and will significantly impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)


I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two.

I understand I should have submitted more frequently, but those final 5 minutes flew by like the fastest 5 minutes of my life.


Please consider accepting my submission


Thanks so much and best regards,

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)


I  am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.


I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.


Could you please consider my request?


Thank you.

Hi [@21f3002158](/u/21f3002158)


I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.


Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.


There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.


Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,  I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and  finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that


Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process


Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.

Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.


I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save

Hi [@23f3002537](/u/23f3002537)


The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.


`from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":

Hello [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,


Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.


I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.


Please re consider this request sir.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Could you please verify if my score will be accepted by you? I saved only once: at 1:47 pm. My roll number is 21f2001573.

I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.


Regards

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).


Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.


I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.


Please reconsider if possible.

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.

Respected Sir,


I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.


Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.


Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.


Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted

The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered.
