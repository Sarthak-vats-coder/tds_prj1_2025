Mail I received Yesterday:


[![This is an email informing a learner that their Project 1 submission will not be evaluated because they failed to meet minimum prerequisites.  The email lists five requirements, including having a public GitHub repository with a valid Dockerfile and MIT license, and a publicly accessible Docker image matching the repository's Dockerfile. The evaluation shows that only the Docker image met the requirements; the rest failed.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/0/f001f7be7e533353ac4526f1cf9d82d4211ea6e1_2_690x265.png)Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-01-071174×451 54.2 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/0/f001f7be7e533353ac4526f1cf9d82d4211ea6e1.png)


Previous Correct Evaluation Mail:


[![This email informs a learner about the evaluation of their Project 1 Docker image submission.  It details the evaluation process, provides links to log files and other relevant files, explains the scoring system, and outlines a process for reporting issues or discrepancies.  The final scores are not yet available, but preliminary results are given.

Good Morning Sir,


This is my github repo: [GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1](https://github.com/kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1) ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)


I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me.  Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.

Apologies for that,


The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.


Kind regards

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),


I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:



The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:


[![This is an email containing the results of a project evaluation.  The sender assessed a Docker image submission, noting missing files resulted in a score of 0.  Links to logs and other relevant files are included, along with an explanation of the evaluation process and environment.  The recipient has until Tuesday to report any issues.

[![This is an email containing the results of a project evaluation.  The student, 22t1 se2002, failed to meet the minimum requirements for Project 1 because their GitHub repository lacked a `LICENSE` file and `Dockerfile`.  Although their Docker image was publicly accessible, the project failed due to missing files in the repository.  The overall project score is 0.

My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:


[GitHub repo](https://github.com/23f2000345/TDS_final)


Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.


Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi,


Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir?


My GitHub repository for Project-1: [GitHub - sudhishssn134/project_1_tds](https://github.com/sudhishssn134/project_1_tds)


Thanking You


Just attaching the mail I recieved.


[![This is an email containing the results of a project evaluation.  The sender assessed a Docker image submission, noting missing files resulting in a score of zero.  The email includes links to log files detailing the evaluation's technical performance and a summary of the assessment.  It also mentions that the final score is not yet determined and encourages the recipient to report any bugs.

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:


`tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())`


You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv.

# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]

Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below

    Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sudhishssn134/project_1_tds/blob/main/Dockerfile)) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation. 
Project 2 : Response we received through google form was [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api) which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
