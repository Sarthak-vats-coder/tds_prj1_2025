[![The image shows a terminal window displaying the output of a GitHub Actions workflow running the Super-Linter.  The workflow encountered an error: it couldn't find the file `/action/lib/functions/tapLibrary.sh`, and later failed to view a version file.  There's also some seemingly random text interspersed in the output.
