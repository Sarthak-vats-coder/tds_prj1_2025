I am a student enrolled in the Tools in Data Science (TDS) module at IIT Madras. I recently completed and submitted the assigned project, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions.


However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected.


I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result.


I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed.


I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it.


To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions.
