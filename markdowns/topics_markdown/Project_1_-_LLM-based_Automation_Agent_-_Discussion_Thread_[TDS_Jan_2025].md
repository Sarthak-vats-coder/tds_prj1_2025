Please post any questions related to [Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-1).


Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM


Update on 27 Jan 2025:


A sample evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at [tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1)


You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.


Please note:



This is a sample. It WILL change.
Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It WILL change.
LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:

Your code gives correct results reliably (i.e. try a few times)
Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations


Your [AI Proxy usage](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
For those who [submit their code](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog) by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

Hi Guddu ,


I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?


command that I used :


`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`


here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.


Kind regards

Hi Aishik,


Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.

Possible reasons for this issue:



Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests.
Token not being correct.

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest_number> file? Please clarify.

do we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux?

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:


Deliverables,


and an example of the Evaluation has been provided.


If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.


[![Image description failed](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/8/488e23f9ea65d35c5ba806fab09f4b5934ed2ed4_2_500x500.png)Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764×1764 374 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/8/488e23f9ea65d35c5ba806fab09f4b5934ed2ed4.png)


Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.


So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.


Kind regards

You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks.

There won’t be any project1 page such as GA1s, there is a google form(which can be found in same page) which needs to be filled after you do project1.

Hi [@23f2005325](/u/23f2005325) ,


Extracting details from credit cards is sensitive, try using strong prompts or take code from LLM and execute it in script.


kind regards

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission)  would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible


More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environmen




In Tuesday’s(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.


What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:



Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
Pull an existing docker image.
Run that image inside a container.
Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
Once done you can commit it.
And push customized container’s image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session.

We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.


If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned especially the pre - requisites mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and there will be no appeal for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.


In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

For A6, /data/docs/ has subfolders with .md files from which we have to extract the heading level 1’s (#) right? Apparently there are few files with different content but the same name. Can someone confirm the same? If yes how to address these files [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

I had set up the environment and dependencies and everything was working fine. When i tried to recreate it from scratch in a new codespace it broke. I fixed almost everything except this error

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382),


Yes datagen.py must be present in same directory from where you  are executing evaluate.py.


Oh, You trying to use crewai locally for Project1

Hi [@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) ,


Filepath is unique for every file, which needs to be inserted to json file.

Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?

no crewai, it takes really long i put time out for 300 secs(in run(task:str) in evaluate.py) still sometimes its not enough. I’ll try with autogen next and then langchain

Hi Guddu,


We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.


Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.


In this case you would write out the the `expected` variable in the `evaluate.py` and see if `result` variable matches the `expected`. Then you can figure out what went wrong.


Kind regards

But please try to take those sessions sooner


Because it’s taking too much time for me to do any problem(plus two more courses and one oppe you know) .so I just want to build the project before deadline.

the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.


Do you think we could access a better model?


Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?


because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.


So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.


I spent a week on this just saying

Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all the phase A tasks on a high level but I’m struggling to start the implementation of the first task in phase A. I’m confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don’t know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats. I would appreciate if I could get in contact with anyone who could guide me in the right direction.

Hello everyone, [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton)


I had a few queries regarding the project;



I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”?
Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”

For Project-1 to complete, it requires:


"You MUST complete ALL these 3 steps to get a score. Failure to do so will result in getting 0 in the project. If you do not do ALL these 3 steps before the deadline, there will be no appeal available.


• Fill the form that is on the Project Page


But I did not get the form; where is it? While I checked inside the project pages also.

My take on autonomous agents. Limited by model capabilities to some extent. Will use function calling hence forth but here is a quick look at using crewai for agent tasks.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir, I see that the project 1 timeline was changed from February 7 - 17, 2025 to January 17 - February 15 which undoubtedly is a good increase in duration. However, I have my GATE DA exam on Feb 15 and the exam center is unexpectedly far. So, I request you to consider pushing the deadline to at least Feb 16. If not, I’ll still do my best.

Hello! [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)


Is the proxy server down right now?


I am getting this error when I am accessing the endpoint:


{‘id’: ‘chatcmpl-Axq55TzulOVjHYuXYIhkRQzCC3PNl’, ‘object’: ‘chat.completion’, ‘created’: 1738824915, ‘model’: ‘gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18’, ‘choices’: [{‘index’: 0, ‘message’: {‘role’: ‘assistant’, ‘content’: …, ‘costError’: ‘crypto.createHash is not a function’}


Or, do I have to install crypto module?

[@21f3002390](/u/21f3002390) - AI Proxy is working and you did get the result. You can ignore any `costError`. It won’t happen in the future anyway.


What’s happening? I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, `crypto.createHash` is not supported in CloudFlare. [I fixed that](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy/commit/5943b6d355deffff88ac07d17aa0c6969cacc3d5) by removing this. I’ll introduce caching later if required.

For the question #A8 on recognizing the credit card number in the image, Open AI doesn’t seem to be recognizing the number correctly and as a result the evaluation is failing. What should be the solution?

A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.


For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?

Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.


Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.


The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.


We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.


Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also?


Some questions about ‘B’ group tasks:


Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will `datagen.py` also generate files for these?


Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned?


Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?


B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database


B7. Compress or resize an image


B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file


B9. Convert Markdown to HTML


B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

its expecting to  match every single detail in that even " and ’ .


in that case changing evaluate.py will result in zero or less marks.


llm will only handle  -calling function based on query and parameter   . What is it going to do about the logic of functions.


If i still focus on passing evaluate.py will it be any good sir [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

Sorry, sir, not trying to be rude, but there isn’t a single full-fledged project session. It’s a bit difficult to dive into the project without guidance on how to do it. It would be nice to have a full project session where we can start a project from the beginning and follow it to completion.

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 & 3.


The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.

Hi Aindree,


No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was updated on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.


Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

This would be only for a selected few questions right because say for the credit card question, where the LLM is involved, to get the card number itself, we have to give a fine-tuned and strong query.

I have done the a1 to a10 task and tried querying through localhost and its working fine basically all these ten steps but dont know whether its enough or not. also steps in phase B i am confused that should we create separate endpoints for these tasks or should it be with same /run endpoint and query. then will the input be random by any user. what about the output . where should it be given. phase b needs more explanation.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)


Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.


I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.


I am also able to use the count_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count_wednesdays.


But when I am entering a query such as “count_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I am unable to get a response.

Almost done with A tasks. Please use this for local llm to verify output


Also Ollama doesn’t require Schemas




CHECK OUT THE REPO AND ANY INPUTS ARE WELCOME

Hi Andrew,


You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.


I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.


In other words getting 10/10 in `evaluate.py` does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.


So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task.


That said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).


Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)


A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (possibly your first task) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.


Kind regards

Respected [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,


Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing students’ concerns?


I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:



[https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions](https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions)

This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.


Thanks,


Telvin Varghese

Hi,


I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very near.


The problem I am facing is, When I did the Modules the page was different, but now in the Project 1 I am not getting any section to submit the project.


Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that.


The deadline is near.

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before


Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.


I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.

Hi Telvin


You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.


[![Image description failed](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/b/1b74cf0c060e28cd3459173bce28d123a8d5da05_2_690x423.png)Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm2078×1276 305 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/b/1b74cf0c060e28cd3459173bce28d123a8d5da05.png)


In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50


As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ (i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs) for us!


The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.


In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.


Kind regards

I’m aware of that. I’ve mostly noticed a cost of $0.0003 per request, so I haven’t been tracking my total monthly expenses. Moving forward, I’ll keep a record of the cost for each request. Also, do strong prompts impact the overall cost?

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).


Kindly advise on this [@carlton](/u/carlton)

For the task - * B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data


Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an endpoint for doing so?

Dear Instructors ([@carlton](/u/carlton), [@iamprasna](/u/iamprasna)):


Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:


It will solely be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct `AIPROXY_TOKEN` generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated `AIPROXY_TOKEN`s of the students who have generated one); and the correct `$IMAGE_NAME` (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`, correct?


Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.

I am also facing the same issue, just that the ordering is different.


Sorting by keys also didn’t help.

sir will the tasks of Phase A and Phase B change? like currently do we need to make llm write the code for all tasks dynamically or can we write a pre defined python code to execute tasks after the llm parses the task and runs python code

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).


Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error is.

could you please help me out on how to start with TDS Project-1, as I am stuck at the moment and don’t know where to start from. This project is very much unfamiliar for me and I need some guidance on how to start with it. It would be really great if you could provide some help through resources/materials/videos and help me complete the project. Thanks in advance!

My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size?


PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some other base image now.

Go through the week 1-3 assignments once, you would be good to go with Phase A tasks.

You do not need the whole of ubuntu!


Just python and uv


More like 128mb image.


Please watch Tues week 5 session 1

I could pull it down to 610 mb, using python:3.9-slim now, but there are some essential libraries that is needed which is taking up the space…will it be ok? I mean installing on the go with uv might lead to timeout during evaluation…

Sir in main.py file I’m defining task with different variables . But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I’m testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I’m testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful.


My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change.


Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks

Hi instructors and TAs,


For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.


eg.



Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response?

I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.


Thanks,


Trebhuvan

will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits.

Hi [@Rishabh2](/u/rishabh2)


What exactly you mean by variables?  only one argument is required for running `evaluate.py` that’s an email address.


You need to download both `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` in same folder and then execute `evaluate.py` using uv.


`uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email`.


For phase B

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)


This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.


The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.


What you can do is, try to fool it using itself. Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.

Things to be checked at your end.


1.`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` works fine


2.  Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected.

Because my project is done but for evaluation if my `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is used, it might be out of credits.

podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=“$AIPROXY_TOKEN” -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME




Yes this is correct command, we will update in project page.

    After submitting docker image through, it will be pulled and our token will be used. 
Things to be checked at your end. 
1. podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME works fine 
2.  Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected. 
Kind regards.

Install datagen.py in the same folder from where you are executing evaluate.py.


[@vikramjncasr](/u/vikramjncasr) Check how you are executing, use uv or else install required modules globally

Sir,


the folder already exists in that folder


besides, I am using `OPENAI_API_KEY=$AIPROXY_TOKEN uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/evaluate.py` from Anand sir’s page to run the code in my system

I sense ‘Authentication Problem’ happens only with the evaluation script, as the curl requests seems to work fine.

Hello Sir [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)


What are implications on missing the project 1.


Due to some personal reasons I wasn’t able to start any work on my project 1. It seems difficult for me to complete it.


Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments and projects?


Thank you


PS: This isn’t any request to extend dates. I accept my fault and respect the dates provided by the team.

Sir I haven’t initaiated the podman earlier.


Now when i try to use podman using the wsl via the code “sudo apt install -y podman” it is asking for the password…


The problem is:



I haven’t set any password for podman earlier.
Though it is asking for password but it is not taking any input.(ie I am unable type anything there).


what should I am supposed to do…

Could we create an image first of our project in initial stage(ie the my “app.py” is not completely ready) but I have build an docker image including the app.py and other dependencies.


Should I give the same url now and then carry on updating the app.py


Or, Should first complete and then upload in the form!

I’m getting the following error while post mapping, I couldn’t able to fix it.


I’m getting status code as 400 from the llm api response. How to fix it sir?


`"json": {

There is some problem with the json that you are using.


Try to debug it with GPT.

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) sir, I have implemented the code for B3 & B6 but unfortunately as per the instructions given in project for B3 & B6 —




B6. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website




B3. Fetch data from an API and save it




They are almost similar and it’s getting confusing in both cases, it’s given output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help me out with this?


Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue?

Two solutions



give proper permissions.
use docker containers this is what we will test on.

I would prefer 2nd approach

For B tasks use LLM to write code on the fly and execute it, use better prompts. In evaluation script detailed task will be provided with what data needs to be scraped, endpoints, parameters, etc.

local llm also we cant use you because you have some limit on file size, we send long prompt also it doesn’t work xD . What do we do?

Hi,


If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,


In task A6


Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `#` ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ).


Here expected output JSON “key” is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when “path/to/large-language-models.md” is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is “path/to/large-language-models.md”.

This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.


Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder_a/folder_b/md_file should be folder_a/folder_b/md_file as key.

For as task description like this



Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt`

I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the “#” symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.


Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)


sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have


’


`''from datagen import (
    get_markdown,
    get_dates,
    get_contacts,
    get_logs,
    get_docs,
    get_email,
    get_credit_card,
    get_comments,
    get_tickets,
)
'''`
so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first…


Or it should be the part of the automation only…

Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.

you should manually check if the file really exists or not because i think the code and the folder where datagen.py is downloading files(data folder) are different

If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‘#’ and change it to ‘number’ and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.


Or another approach is tell the llm,


If you ever see the phrase ‘count the # of’ in a task, please interpret it as ‘count the number of’. For example


Count the # of Fridays means


Count the number of Fridays

Please read the deliverables and evalute section.


datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.


Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.


Kind regards

Hey [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , I actually submitted the project already in the morning,


I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.


But since I was actively testing with the - `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, I forgot to remove them before submission.


However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

These files are inside a separate folder - `evaluation` in my project root directory. Since I already submitted please do consider.

This indicates your task execution returns  “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” but the execution doesn’t creates the required file in the given location that the evaluation script is requesting.

22f3001011 I’ve enabled “Allow response editing” on the form. I think that means you can edit your response… but since you had submitted it before it was enabled, I’m not sure what the procedure is. Worst case, please submit again.

Install `uv` (if required) and run the script `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py`

very true there is too much confusion Id like to ask if you know that evaluate.py is mean to run only for [user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com) or our own mail too  because there was written You MUST use your Student Id (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Project, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation.

`uv run datagen.py <your_email> --root ./data`
try to include --root ./data in your code

Hello,


just a silly question, if my code runs well in docker environment with `/data` in root directory, will it be fine ?


or should i keep the relative `./data` directory like in the lecture ?


Thanks

The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.


For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.


It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.


Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.


Kind regards

it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)


then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.


Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.


create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv


add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location


and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.


It even happened for me

The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue.

you have to give the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the evaluate.py by either


bash - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`


or


powershell - `$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`


the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.


so you have to set `AIPROXY_TOKEN` in both terminals


i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

I second this, have been trying to debug the project for the past 1 week, spending over 4 hours daily and yet facing issues everytime I reopen. An extension of even 24 hours would be extremely appreciated. Please consider this. Thanks.

Respected Sir,


I sincerely request you to kindly consider granting a one-day extension for Project 1. Many key clarifications were provided in today’s session, and we need just one additional day to effectively implement them. This extension would be immensely helpful in ensuring a more refined submission.


I truly appreciate your time and consideration.


Thank you.

hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.



in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.

any idea about these ?

Blunder in your `main.py`.


You are using API_KEY = os.getenv(“AI_PROXY_TOKEN”) but it should be AIPROXY_TOKEN.


Btw what you using for phase B?

What we expect in project.



server running inside docker container at 8000.
And all files will be accessed from data folder in root directory.

Apart from these two you can have anything extra.

Dear Sir,


This project is highly complex, and we need additional time to ensure its successful completion. We kindly request an extension of the deadline to allow for thorough testing and proper implementation. An extension would greatly help us deliver the best results.

This might be problem with network settings(unstable internet, firewall, VPN interference)


try to debug it with help of chatgpt.


You can also use codespaces for trying another network.

No don’t do that, just follow the procedure.


Two problems with keeping token in file.



It will become public after you push to github.
While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.

Hi ,


I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.


When i run command docker build -t ___________ .

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didn’t work.


I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.


on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use


Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running


Thank You.

Aagman

`A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.


My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?

Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.




Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

When I run my docker image using


`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`


Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.


Running the same image using


`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`


works fine and Task A2 passes. I can’t understand why this is happening.


I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.


When run using docker, `which node` gives `/usr/bin/node` as output but when run using podman, nothing.


`shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# echo $PATH
/root/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
# which node
# exit
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo docker run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# echo $PATH
/root/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
# which node
/usr/bin/node
# exit
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --user=root --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh

Here’s how to prompt folks. Just do what [@carlton](/u/carlton) mentioned in today’s live session (the 5 hour marathon) and you should be good for Project-1!

Most people are still prompting wrong.

I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.

Here’s how it works: [pic.x.com/2MMcEqBeIJ](https://x.com/aakashg0/status/1890492955842007087/photo/1)![Image description failed](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/e/ce7a62f2fa1f33758771e9ef57dd90fe2d98b09d_2_502x500.jpeg)

sir I am noticing a pattern, that when I am running the datagen first. And then using the evaluate.py, then I am getting the A2 right.


But running the evaluation.py for the 2nd time cause the A2 to fail…


Probabbly Because the file in the data folder gets upated should I worry for that…

in the phase B, we have no idea about how many arguments are there, so should we make every function mapping with 2 arguments ( 1 containing the input location and other containing output location) or should we take the parameters in some other way

There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.


Kind regards

We have not specified a size limit for the docker image, so in theory there is not a limit to the docker image size.


Kind regards

Hello  [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir,


While running evaluate.py , I have observed that the expected  and actual output is having difference like “\n” then also it marks task as fail.


eg:

Will this be considered as failure in actual evaluation as well or will this be taken care in actual evaluation?

Use following as first parameter of `subprocess.run()` to create `data/` directory inside your project instead of C: drive


`["uv", "run", script_url, user_email, "--root", "./data"]`
Also, you don’t need to download to script, you can directly run it from the url.

The reason for error is `evaluate.py` is trying to import `datagen.py` which doesn’t exist in your system. I’ll suggest download both the files, keep them in same folder and run `evaluate.py` from your computer

Currently, it can complete 7 out of 10 tasks. In reality, it can complete 9 out of 10 tasks, but the expected results are not flexible in evaluate.py file.


If we can extract credit card numbers, it will be able to complete 10 out of 10 tasks.

sir for this task- A6 Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `#` ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` )   …I am getting correct result for all files but for the very first file budget.md it shows wrong.


my result- { “budget.md”: “Success easy same main modern doctor.”,


“build.md”: “Shoulder follow own never above.”,


and in the data files there is different heading in budget.md.-  # Series dog who make specific agree between.


my question is this if it works for all the files then why not for this file budget.md    [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

Check the file once, there is a possibility that it’s either fetching a comment or the second heading. Refactor your prompt to search only for the First Heading, specify it explixitly.

I am getting this error while running evaluate.py on task A9


`HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"

There were no authentication issues till yesterday.

This is happening because evaluate.py is unable to fetch your API Key from the environment variables. Create a new variable and set it’s value to your API Key then try.

Hi everyone,


I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:


bash


Copy


`https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`
I receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the `"data"` key.


[](#p-595959-what-ive-tried-1)What I’ve Tried

Token Verification:


I’m using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at [aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) with my IITM email.
The token is passed in the header as follows:

python


Copy


`"Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"`

I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).


API Request Details:


The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.
The payload is set as:

json


Copy


`{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}`

Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.


Debug Output:


Here’s a snippet of the debug output:

bash


Copy


`HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
🔴 A9 failed: 'data'`
This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.


[](#p-595959-what-i-suspect-2)What I Suspect

The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.
There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of.
Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.

[](#p-595959-request-for-help-3)Request for Help
Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks in advance for your assistance!

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database


Should I ask for the SQL data base. Or the agent should be smart enough to find the required database…


Moreover in the data folder there is only one database is it should be robust to handle multiple databases…

I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using `podman rmi -a` and then ran `podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME` with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1). But this gave me the following error:


`Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf`
The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.


The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be `docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent`


I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!

It doesnt mention anywhere that the dockerfile must be present in the root directory as a requirement/prerequisite of the project.


In my case its present inside the app directory. Could the team help clarify on this issue.

I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.


Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

Hey team, I just moved my Dockerfile to the root level on my Github repo. Hope this solves the issue.

Dear [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , [@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , and [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)


Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.


[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.


Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.


I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.

Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.




Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1,  link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton)


Dear Sir,


I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.


I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.


I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.


I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.


Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.


Sincerely,


Rishit Jain

I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.


Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.


I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.


Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task_handler.py file of my repository.


I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

My project has MIT licence and Dockerfile was also there… but to reconfirm I pulled my dockerfile from dockerhub to github only .

EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.


what to do



push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images




how will this help?
since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image

@all


use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion


CHEERS

I didn’t submit the google form, I have made the github repo and docker image for TDS project 1. I, mistakenly, thought that I had submitted the google form but actually it was saved as a draft and closed my laptop. As soon as I realized my mistake, I hit the submit button but this was shown then,


“The form TDS Jan 2025 - Project 1 Submission is no longer accepting responses.”


I apologize for this. I have been working on this project for weeks.


This was my first TDS project. I would highly appreciated, if you could help me.

Thank you, sir, for giving us this amazing opportunity! Honestly, I learned more in the last week than I did throughout the three modules.


The project was a rollercoaster ride—especially with all the errors that kept popping up—but overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of knowledge I gained was truly valuable.


A huge thanks to [@Carlton](/u/carlton), [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini), and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir for their guidance and support. Without the last week’s lectures, the project couldn’t have been completed.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.

This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.


I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.


Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) and also got the chance to help a few.


I thank the entire TDS team - [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir, [@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) for their support throughout this amazing experience.


Regards,


Pradeep Mondal

It clearly says in your error message:


Invalid value: ‘json’


if you look at the “type” key in your response_format variable at the top,


the value cannot be “json”


The error is telling you what the supported values are


‘json_object’, ‘json_schema’, and ‘text’


Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‘json_schema’


So therefore you should change


`"type": "json"`
to


`"type": "json_schema"`
If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,


either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular


[https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction)


There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.

No human peer reviews. The peer will be an LLM that has been given the rubrics and fine tuned.

I know this is a late reply, but its not possible for us to consider changes to your project after the deadline for academic integrity purposes.


If we were to allow it, we would have to allow everyone to make changes to their project as well for it to be fair.

Alright, [@Carlton](/u/carlton). No problem at all, and thank you for your response.


I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience.


And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: “Give loose marking for effort!”—because, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit! ![Image description failed](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12)

sir it seems like there was a problem when i pushed this files to the repo but i defenitely did correctly. PLease allow me to add docker file alone with your permission. As you can see i haven’t opened the dockerfile since the last date of project 1. Kindly allow this sir. and i have MiT license in my repo but still showing fail . kindly check that also sir.

sir it seems like there was a problem when i pushed this files to the repo but i defenitely did correctly. PLease allow me to add docker file alone with your permission. As you can see i haven’t opened the dockerfile since the last date of project 1. Kindly allow this sir. and i have MiT license in my repo but still showing fail . kindly check that also sir.
