I had completed project 2 but because of a mistake i filled the form with my personal mail id fue to which the project eas not evaluated i fully consider this to be my fault and assure that something like this will not happen in the future .


If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me


I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities


It will be really helpful if you can access the project
