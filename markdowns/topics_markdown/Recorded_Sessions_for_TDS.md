I received an email about upcoming changes stating that recorded live sessions will no longer be provided to encourage participation in live sessions. Could someone please confirm if this change applies to TDS live sessions as well?


Recorded sessions are valuable for revision, and I’ve noticed that some courses still offer them—are there exceptions in place? Just looking for clarity on whether TDS sessions will continue to be recorded or not.


Thanks!

We won’t stop recording session in TDS.

We understand that students might have other commitments, but that being said, if there are no students in the sessions then we will have to reconsider having them in the first place. Thats why an email was sent to all students.


Kind regards
