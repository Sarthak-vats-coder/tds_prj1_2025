I am writing to kindly request an extension for the submission of Project 1 for the TDS course. The current deadline of June 14 is unfortunately clashing with several other academic and co-curricular commitments.


We have Paradox Fest scheduled just before the deadline, along with multiple assignment submissions across other courses. Due to this, I am finding it difficult to allocate sufficient time and focus towards completing the project with the quality it deserves.


I genuinely want to put in my best effort for this project and would be extremely grateful if the deadline could be extended by a few days to allow for proper completion.

Yes I support this.. Please extend the deadline. Many of us are beginners and need some more time to properly understand and make a project of this type

Agreed, deadline should be extended for the project1.


This whole thing is kinda a lot to cover and as we’re beginners, the whole LLM thing is kinda taking time to process whole thing and I guess the coursework has been revamped a lot.


And there’s a lot to cover along with this subject.


So kindly if deadline extension can be provided ..

I also genuinely feel the deadline should be extended, because of Paradox fest. I’m a coordinator in the Culturals Team. We are dedicating more time in the fest than others, including reaching there earlier. Also, we have deadlines for other courses and projects as well. Please consider this and extend the deadline.

Yeah, because of the paradox, it is tough for me to submit the project on 14


. I would reach home at 11 or maybe 12 if the train is late. So it would be tough for me to submit the project on 14. Please give us 3-4 day extension

Yes, we need time because after GA3 submission we will be in paradox and will be back by 10 June and deadline is 14 June, 4 days are not sufficient. Kindly please extend the deadline.

Yess Sir we need some time to properly learn and implement a project of this scale. Given we also have paradox, please think about us and extend the deadline sir. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
