You wrote the same post twice in two different threads. Not only is that bad etiquette, there was also an answer give to your question in the main project thread immediately after your question.

    The issue still seems to be there [@carlton](/u/carlton) about the missing promptfoo file. 
Its still accessible from [https://tds.s-anand.net/project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml](https://tds.s-anand.net/project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml) , but on the exam submission portal its linked to its relative path file, which does not exist. 
You can get the file from [https://tds.s-anand.net/project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml](https://tds.s-anand.net/project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml)


Do NOT double post. All posts are read by multiple people including the prof.
