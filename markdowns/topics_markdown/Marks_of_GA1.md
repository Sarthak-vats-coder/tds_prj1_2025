Hi Kritika,


I have just checked your submission. I apologise that your score has not reflected on your dashboard. I was not given an updated enrollment list of students on the course, so although we have your submission scores it was not pushed to the dashboard because as far as I was aware you were not on TDS enrollment list that was provided to us by operations [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) . We will make the corrections and inform operations. It will take a few days to get sorted out.


Thanks for letting us know and for your patience.


Kind regards


TDS Team
