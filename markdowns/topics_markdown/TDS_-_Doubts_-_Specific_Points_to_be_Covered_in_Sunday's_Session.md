Hi Friends,


I’ve opened this thread for tracking specific doubts / points / topics that we all want our sir to cover in the session scheduled on Sunday, 18-5-25


Please keep appending your doubts here.


Thanks,


Prasad.

I don’t know where to start… But let me share this screenshot (part of “uv” installation)…


[![The image shows a web browser displaying the installation instructions for the `uv` Python package.  The instructions detail how to install using PyPI (with `pipx` or `pip`) and Cargo, noting that the Cargo method requires building from a Git repository.  A sidebar lists additional documentation topics.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/2/5/251cec053727261d71ef6f8bb189c37f0127830a_2_690x388.png)image1920×1080 302 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/5/251cec053727261d71ef6f8bb189c37f0127830a.png)


Here, I really did not understand, what I’ve to do, and why? What I don’t have to do, if any?


Also don’t know anything about PyPi, Cargo, how they are related to “uv”…


More importantly don’t know whether this is a valid doubt or not too. More over, how to express doubts in almost every line (some times feeling shy too).


As we (most of the students) are not ready to take up this course (with so many such stupid / doubts), it increases load on the instructors, TAs, and every teaching staff.


From students side, this is causing lot of distress, as we struggle to raise so many doubts and get them clarified. By the team we read a line and try to understand what it means, we get another doubt.


I strongly feel that “Diploma in Programming” (or set of subjects) must be made as a pre-requisite to this (TDS) course and any other such courses too.


Alternatively, we have to create BRIDGE course sort of thing and make it a part of formal curriculum to reduce stress and distress in students and make teaching staff life better.


I don’t know whom do I need to take this up, but request our TAs to carry our voice / message to the concerned authorities.


Thanks,


Prasad.

Just to share my difficulty, another example I wish to share is here below…


[![The image shows a browser window displaying a graded assignment on a web page.  The assignment involves running a command in a terminal and providing the output, as well as a section on using spreadsheet software (Excel and Google Sheets).  A timer shows 11:32:14 remaining. The student's current score is 0.75/10.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/f/1f96d041599fe67721df22d2335f30c6c5c7965c_2_690x388.png)image1920×1080 197 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/f/1f96d041599fe67721df22d2335f30c6c5c7965c.png)


As mentioned in the screenshot / instructions, I’ve downloaded “README.md” file and then tried to run the specified command “npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum” (I don’t know, what it means and what it does, but still blindly tried to run). I get the below error (screenshot given below). It says "term ‘npx’ is not recognized.


[![A screenshot of a VS Code terminal showing errors indicating that the commands `npx` and `run` are not recognized.  The user was likely attempting to install or run a program using npm.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/9/f9fae5c5143da5642d4a949b0bc5bc6f49931957_2_690x388.png)image1920×1080 175 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/9/f9fae5c5143da5642d4a949b0bc5bc6f49931957.png)


To be honest, I don’t even know (however, based on the videos I watched, I think I’ll have to run somewhere in Linux. Is it same as “powershell”? ) where exactly I need to run the command.


I’m throwing stones in dark. Unfortunately, even when I get correct answer (like Questions 1 thru 3), I don’t know what that means and what I achieved.


This is frustrating (I understand how much it will frustrate our instructors, when we don’t even know what we know and what we don’t know).

Some one guided me that I’ve to install Git & run these commands from Git Bash terminal. I’ve installed Git and tried to run “npx” command from there. Is this not “Git Bash” terminal?


[![A Windows terminal window showing a directory listing and an error message "bash: npm: command not found".  The taskbar at the bottom shows several application icons.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/7/c71fa0021938658ab6aaccd492703c14aa782274_2_690x388.png)image1920×1080 115 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/7/c71fa0021938658ab6aaccd492703c14aa782274.png)


This will be my last doubt posting here. Not planning to post any more doubts as our instructors by know understand, our level and how to handle us OR help us from here.


Others can keep adding their own doubts as they feel necessary.


Thanks,


Prasad.
