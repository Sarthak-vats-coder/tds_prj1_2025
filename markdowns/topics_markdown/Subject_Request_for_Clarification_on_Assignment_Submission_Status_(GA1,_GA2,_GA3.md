I am writing to inform you that I have submitted all the graded assignments—GA1, GA2, and GA3—on time. However, the portal is still showing them as “Not Submitted.” I have worked sincerely and put in a lot of effort into completing these assignments, and I am concerned that the portal might not have registered my submissions correctly. i have saved them before submitting sucessfully.


I kindly request you to look into this matter at your earliest convenience. More students are facing these issues, please address.

Please check your email, you would have received and official email from us with your scores for each of your GAs. The dashboard will always have some delay because the portal and our site are not linked, thats why we send out the mail.


We currently have on record for you 10, 7 and 9.5 respectively for you GA scores.

Every student has the same issue. Its not unique to a few. All of them will have the scores pushed to dashboard by the operations team at the same time. The official email from us is your proof of your actual score. Dashboard scores will be updated in due time.


Kind regards
