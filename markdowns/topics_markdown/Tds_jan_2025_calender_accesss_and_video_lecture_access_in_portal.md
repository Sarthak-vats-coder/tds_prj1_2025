Same issue with me sir.


This is how my dashboard looks like. It shows the same for week 2 as well.

At [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) the course calendar is also available.

Likewise the GAs also are available through the links in the seek portal as well as on the course domain shared above.


The course introduction has very important information. Many students who faced problems in Tools for Data Science in previous terms usually never read the intro. Please be diligent to read everything carefully.


Don’t gloss over these bits (they are expandable if you click on them) for eg…
