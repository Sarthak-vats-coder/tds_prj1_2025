Hi,


Iâ€™ve registered for this (TDS) course in the current term along with MLT. But when I see the course content closely, it looks more like core programming. I feel more comfortable to take up this course after completing (Java & other) courses available in Diploma in Programming.


So, can I drop this course now? If so, will I get full fee refund? If not full, how much would they refund?


BTW, if drop course is possible, what are the start and end dates for this facility?


Thanks,


Prasad.

You can check for the same in the Student Handbook. Specifically at the following link.

I too have taken MLT and TDS after the first 4 subjects in combined Diploma path. I had the same thoughts as you. I am waiting for course drop google form to be floated.

Student handbook says, course cancellation / dropping a course should happen within 4 weeks of commencement.


What is commencement date here for the current term?


When can we expect the form for dropping the course?
