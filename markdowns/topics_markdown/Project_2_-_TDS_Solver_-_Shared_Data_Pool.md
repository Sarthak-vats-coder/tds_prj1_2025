`# TDS-Project2-QuestionBank
Question Bank for all TDS assignments

# Requested format
## Student Assignments Directory Structure

Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
- A `.txt` file with the question statement.
- A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.

### Example Directory Structure
RollNo_12345/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assignment_1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q1.txt    # Question for Q1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q1.py     # Solution in Python
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q2.txt    # Question for Q2
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q2.sh     # Solution in Bash
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q3.txt    # Question for Q3
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q3.js     # Solution in JavaScript
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assignment_2/`
