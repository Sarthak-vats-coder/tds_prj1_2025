Having a coding background, the first GA seemed really easy. So I started the course thinking that it’ll be an easy S grade course for me. Oh how wrong was I!!


The sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it’s just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I’ve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir.


[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable.


[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](/u/carlton) I’m sure it wasn’t an easy task being the TA of this course. Thanks for all the help throughout the term with the Mock ROEs, project sessions and clearing doubts in discourse and live sessions.


I still got an S grade but it was a very hard-fought S with the help of some luck. I’d love to follow the changes this course goes through in the upcoming terms.


Thanks


Regards,


Shivaditya Bhattacharya

Hi [@22f3000819](/u/22f3000819),


First of all congratulations on scoring a S grade in the subject claimed to be the hardest of all in the program, its truly a feat of its own. This post reminds me of the farewell post I wrote for my TAs [@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@Amit1](/u/amit1) back in May’24 term when I was a student of TDS. This course is more of an experience that a student goes through. The sleepless nights for projects, the thrill and rush of the ROE, and the satisfaction of an easy End Term ![That's a laughing-so-hard-I'm-crying emoji.  It's a yellow circle face with a wide, open mouth smile and tears streaming down its cheeks.

This course builds the confidence within a person to face challenging scenarios and a believe to come at the top of it. Honestly, I learnt a lot about being a TA in this course. It was an experience worth living. So, thank you Shivaditya, looking at students like you, it feels like our efforts paid off.


All the best for your next term.


Best Wishes


Saransh Saini


TDS TA

This course was the most exciting and memorable of all the courses I have taken so far (actually of all the courses in the diploma level, I have completed all ![That's a simple, smiling yellow emoticon or emoji.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=14) by now ). I had the technical background and as [@22f3000819](/u/22f3000819) mentioned I thought it was going to be an easy ride but I was wrong. It was challenging as well as fun at the same time.


The best part of the course is that it is open internet and we are free to explore, use LLMs and get the things done. This way of learning to me is the most effective. I have the guide and now I can devise how I should approach the things.


Everything ROE, Project 1, Project 2 was quite challenging and fun at the same time. Projects were the best part of the course. I learned how things can go wrong when we deploy it. I collaborated with [@ItsMeAlex](/u/itsmealex) , [@trebhuvansb](/u/trebhuvansb) , [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) and [@22f3002933](/u/22f3002933) for Project 2.


My Project 2 repo even got 17 forks and 4 stars and scored 20/20 on evaluation. This adventure ended with the relaxing end term paper and an overall “S” grade.


Also I must say the support team of TDS is the best so far in the program. I had conversation with [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) and [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir and they are super helpful. I would really miss these sessions. I attended the live sessions by [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir and sir’s take on the questions were really insightful and even made me think differently than my perspective.


When we do something different it ought to have challenges both operational and technical but the TDS support team tried to give its best. Many a times I too had raised concerns but the team tried to resolve it to their best capabilities.


At last I would like to say, without any hesitation, I had experienced the best part of the program till now in the last 3-4 months. Hoping to meet the team and my fellow peers in person during the Paradox ![That's a simple, smiling yellow emoticon or emoji.

My TDS Journey


“A Tale of Bugs, Chaos & Miraculous Comebacks” ![That's a laughing emoji with a single drop of sweat on its temple.  It conveys nervous laughter or amusement that's slightly uncomfortable or awkward.

](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/fire.png?v=14)


So, I did something bold (or reckless, depends on how you see it)—took the TDS (Tools in Data Science) course right in my first term. Why? Because curiosity got the better of me, and I thought, “Eh, GA1 went fine, how hard could it be?” (Spoiler: Very hard.) Not a decision I recommend unless you’re into academic masochism. ![That's a laughing emoji with a single drop of sweat on its temple.  It conveys nervous laughter or amusement that's slightly uncomfortable or awkward.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=14)


The first few modules hit me like three courses merged into one ![That's an illustration of a small stack of three books, each a different color (red, dark green/black, and blue).  They are depicted in a simple, cartoonish style.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/books.png?v=14). Maybe because I was totally unprepared, maybe because TDS has a secret pact with chaos.


Did all 7 GA …it was very time consuming but fun too …learnt new tools with every question. But hey, the live lectures were fantastic ![That's a simple, pixelated illustration of a microphone.  It's gray with a light blue band around the head.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/microphone.png?v=14), the modules were well-structured ![That's a pixel art image of an orange construction crane lifting a red object (possibly a beam or bundle of materials).
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/building_construction.png?v=14), and thank goodness for the lifesaving Discourse forum and group, where the real MVPs reside ![That's a pixel art image of a gold trophy cup with two handles and a small base.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/trophy.png?v=14).


Then came Project 1. Ah yes, my nemesis. I’d write code, it would run perfectly, then—bam! A random error just to keep things from getting doable⚠️. Was it 404? 500? Who knows! I basically developed muscle memory for every error code in existence ![That's a simple, pixelated image of a light blue or grey laptop computer.  The screen is dark and blank.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/laptop.png?v=14)![That's an emoticon or emoji depicting a surprised, possibly overwhelmed face.  It has large eyes, an open mouth, and a head exploding with steam, light, and colorful sparks, suggesting a mental overload or burst of energy/ideas.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/exploding_head.png?v=14). The grand result? 2/20. At this point, my grade looked like it had fallen off a cliff ![That's a stylized illustration of a snow-capped mountain range at night, with small white stars surrounding it.  The style is simple and slightly cartoonish.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/snow_capped_mountain.png?v=14), and I wasn’t sure if I could salvage an B—or even a C, honestly… with -18 in my balance due to P1 and a trauma for P2 I couldn’t have expected more… no?


Entered the TA sessions and peer-powered survival squad ![That's a stylized image of a light blue/grey shield.  The shield has a lighter colored inner section and a darker border studded with small, light blue dots.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/shield.png?v=14)—my saving grace. ROE, the supposedly impossible exam, where I thought even a 50% would be a miracle?..got 100%. Same for Project 2—100%. Even after initially refusing to believe it, reality set in, and my **end-term score also landed around 90 ** (thanks to the PYQs and those 300 github ques…definitely recommending the next term student to solve and understand all the pyqs fr), then wrapping the final score with some gift wrappers of a few bonus marks… this deal got sealed with a confident A …

This course was brutal, but in the best way possible ![That's a pixel art image of a lightbulb, glowing yellow and brightly lit.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/light_bulb.png?v=14). It threw me into battles with LLMs, never-ending questions, and existential crises over debugging ![That's a simple icon depicting a magnifying glass.  It's light blue with a gray handle, commonly used to represent search or zoom functions.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/magnifying_glass_tilted_left.png?v=14). But now, I have actual skills (and scars) that I’ll carry into my future projects of MAD1, MAD2, MLP, and BDM which will be a whole new experience🚀.


Looking back, the syllabus was a wild mix of survival skills and superpowers—building models, deploying them, wrestling with LLMs, and somehow convincing messy data to behave. And just when we thought we had conquered it all, Project 1 pulled us into the abyss. Now, with Data Analysis and Visualization still in the works, the adventure wasn’t over. Because what’s data science without some surprises and flashy charts to flex? ![That's a laughing emoji.  It's a yellow circle face with its eyes squeezed shut and a wide, open mouth showing teeth and a tongue.  It conveys extreme amusement or laughter.

For future students? Take it later in the diploma, enjoy the mad ride, and remember—even if you bomb a project, there can always be a comeback. ![That's a pixel art image of a gold trophy cup with two handles and a small base.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/trophy.png?v=14) TDS is tough, but resilience matters more than perfection. Even if you get 10/100(which I got) on a project, learn from it, adapt, and come back stronger.


Massive thanks to [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir for making this learning experience possible, and a special shoutout to [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) sir, and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) for patiently resolving our chaotic issues ![That's an emoji depicting two hands pressed together in a prayer or pleading gesture.

Your guidance made a challenging journey both rewarding and insightful. Grateful for everything!
