‚ÄúStudents are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.‚Äù


So I did. ![Image description failed](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/man_tipping_hand.png?v=14)

Yes, I got great marks in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.


But let‚Äôs be real‚Ä¶


It was my Labrador who did the actual work ![Image description failed](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/service_dog.png?v=14)![That's a simple, pixelated illustration of a human brain, rendered in shades of pink against a black background.

While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:



Solving deployment issues faster than my dev server boots
Writing function calling code like a true GPT whisperer
Fixing LLM bugs that I didn‚Äôt even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.


He growled at broken APIs.


I took the credit. ![Image description failed](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/nail_polish.png?v=14)

‚ÄúThank you all for an awesome semester!


I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.


But I am personally offended by one thing‚Ä¶‚Äù




‚ÄúHow dare you give bonus marks on Week 7?


I skipped it ‚Äî just like many ‚Äî because we were told only best 4 of 7 would count.


I demand justice. And a belly rub.‚Äù

Let your pets help with your coursework.


You get the grade. They get the rage.

After fighting so much for GA, ROE, Project 1, and Project 2, my inner animal got hurt and fell asleep ‚Äî and that‚Äôs how I ended up missing GA7. Please don‚Äôt hurt him any further.
