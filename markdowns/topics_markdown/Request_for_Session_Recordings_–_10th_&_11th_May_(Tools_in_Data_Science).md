Please subscribe to the channel. It will notify you as soon as new videos are uploaded.


Additionally, they are also in the calendar.


Currently only the Sat 10th session has been uploaded. The Sun 11th session will take a bit longer because we are doing some automation tool trials. We hope to upload it today.


Kind regards
