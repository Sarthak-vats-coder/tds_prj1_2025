Whoever wants can participate and then we go into breakout rooms and each group solves a particular question and then we all share the code so we can complete the ROE faster and more effienctly?

Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this.

Sharing answers is asking for help

If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right?


Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split  the tasks efficiently and get it done.


Thoughts?

[@ankit.jain](/u/ankit.jain) – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. 
What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. 

Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”
Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”

Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. 
Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…

Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing answers in a public forum.
