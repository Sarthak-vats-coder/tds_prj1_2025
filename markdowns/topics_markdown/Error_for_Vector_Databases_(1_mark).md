Hi ,


I am getting the following error "{‘error’: {‘message’: ‘You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.)’, ‘type’: ‘insufficient_quota’, ‘param’: None, ‘code’: ‘insufficient_quota’}}


Please help.


Thanks

Use Gpt4.1 nano model so that limit does not cross and send only limited request because younwill have limited quota.
