Gives anyone access to an OpenAI/OpenRouter API key free at 10 cents/week. Self-hostable. Useful as a backend if you're building pure front-end LLM apps








(typically $1 per 7 days).


So use carefully crafted (pre tested) code snippets only, and do not run multiple requests if you already had a successful request made. Store the response and reuse the stored response for further tests.


Kind regards
